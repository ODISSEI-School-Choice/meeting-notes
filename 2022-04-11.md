# Meeting notes: 11/04/2022
Participants: Eric, Ji, Jisk, Mike

## Discussion Items
Ji, Erik, and Mike briefly introduced themselves.

Erik briefly introduced the current state of the work: a module was developed to simulate the school segeregation in Amsterdam, it works for small cases (e.g., area or distinct of Amsterdam), but would be nice to have efficiency of this module improved to handle larger scale of data (e.g., the whole Amsterdam) and more model runs.

Jisk mentioned that it's very useful to have a benchmark case, idealy a small case that can touch all parts of the code. 

Jisk also mentioned that it would be nice to have several test cases, to make sure that the calculations are still correct after changing the code. Erik said that it's possible but will need time.

Jisk suggested several possible directions of optimizing the code, e.g., rewriting for loops with numpy, trying compliers like mypy, pypy, cython, etc. 

Mike suggested to also have HPC resources prepared for possible usage, e.g., computing hours of super computers at ODISSEI and SURF. Jisk could help pointing out the right place to ask for these resources.

Mike told about Ji's working arrangement during the project: it's more efficient for Ji to work based in Amsterdam. 

Mike also mentioned that there will be a conference at CBS in the Mid May, it would be nice that Ji (and possibly Jisk) can give a short (10-15mins) presentation explaining the tech issues and challenges there. 

## Action Items
- Erik will send the code and the benchmark dataset to Ji and Jisk.
- Erik will try to work on several test cases.
- Ji will read the paper describing the model and start looking at the code.
- Jisk will point Erik and Mike in the right direction for access to SUFRsara.
