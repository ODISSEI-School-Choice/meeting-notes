# Meeting notes: 29/04/2022
Participants: Eric and Ji

## Discussion Items
- Eric mentions that the master branch is not the latest version, and there will be a branch called `simulations` with some updates.
- Ji wants to know if Eric will also work on the GitHub repo.
	- Yes, and Eric will create another branch of the GitHub repo, with all the updates included
	- UvA will move from GitLab to GitHub, so it's also nice to do this change
- Ji wants to know more about the new branch.
	- What has been done:
		- change on size of the pickle files: for each household, calculating distance to all the schools.
		- efforts to improve the loading speed of pickles
		- modify the `set_agent_parameters` function of the `CompassModel` class
			- Rewrite some objects with numpy arrays
			- Ji mentions that it's still not completely sure if numpy will help here, also depends on memory access.
	- What has been planed: 
		- Update tests in the tests folder if necessary 
			- Those tests haven't been touched for long
			- Eric wants to make sure they are still workable
- Some agreements have been achieved:
	- At the current stage, all the agents will be created and provided as input, and the optimization will then focus on the school process. But it's also expected that the residual process could also be improved by learning from what we will do in this project.
	- Basically any change of the code is acceptable by Eric and Mike, as far as the changes will keep the readability of the code. Ji and Jisk will communicate with Eric and Mike about any significant change of the code. 
- Eric wants to know how often Ji would run the test case.
	- The test case can be quite big and it's time-consuming to run it for many times.
	- No idea for now, Ji will figure out that later
- Eric shows his concern of deploying the code to the server, especially when a different Python compiler than CPython will be applyed.
	- Ji suggests that the virtual environment tool can help handle this issue
	- Anaconda might be more useful than pipenv in this case, Eric also feels okay with Anaconda.
- Ji would like to have the test case to be dumped with Pandas 1.3.5 instead of 1.4.0 for testing some Python compilers.
	- Seems to be not necessary anymore, as we will try out storing data in geojson instead of Python Pickles.
	- Different types of agents can be stored in separate files.

## Action Items
- Eric will work on the test case until next Tuesday.
- Ji will explore different serialization tools in Python.
- Ji will investigate the impact of numpy broadcasting on computing performance.
- If considered to be necessary, Ji, Eric (and Jisk possibly) will meet on next Tuesday for an update.
